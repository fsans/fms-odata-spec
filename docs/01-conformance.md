# 01 — OData Standard Conformance

## Conformance level

FileMaker Server and FileMaker Cloud support OData at the **intermediate conformance level**, with some exceptions.

- **Claris FileMaker 2023 (v20.x)**: implements OData 4.0.
- **Claris FileMaker 2024 (v21.x) onward**: implements partial OData 4.01 at intermediate conformance level. OData 4.01 was designed by OASIS to allow partial adoption, and Claris selectively integrated high-utility features rather than rewriting for full compliance.

The URL version segment remains `v4` for all versions. The `OData-Version` response header may be used to distinguish 4.0 vs 4.01 behavior.

### OData 4.01 features adopted in v21.1+

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Simplified Query Syntax | System query options no longer require `$` prefix (e.g., `select` instead of `$select`) |
| Argument Parameterization | Placeholders for data variables in `$filter` to avoid string concatenation |
| Advanced Query Nesting | Nesting within `$select`, `$expand`, and `$crossjoin` |
| Data Type Casting | On-the-fly type conversion in queries (e.g., `/Edm.String`) |
| Batch Preference Inheritance | Headers set at batch request level cascade to individual operations |

### Key limitations of the partial 4.01 implementation

| Limitation | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `@odata.count` vs `@count` toggle | In full OData 4.01, `@odata.count` was replaced by `@count`. FileMaker lets you pass version headers to toggle between 4.0 and 4.01 behavior to avoid breaking legacy integrations. |
| No layout engine | Unlike the Data API, OData bypasses the layout schema layer entirely, interacting directly with base Table Occurrences on the relationship graph. |
| Missing function evaluations in `$select` | Broad function evaluations in `$select` are not supported, preventing OData from fully replacing ODBC for some use cases. |
| Parameterization is `$filter`-only | Cannot parameterize field names in `$select` or aggregation arguments in `$apply`. |

## FileMaker features not accessible via standard OData calls

These FileMaker features are **not directly accessible** through standard OData API calls, but may be available indirectly via scripts:

| Feature | Workaround |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Access to data in external ODBC data sources | Use scripts |
| Calculation fields depending on FileMaker plug-ins | Use scripts |
| Calculation fields depending on host file system info (e.g. `Get(TemporaryPath)`) | Use scripts |
| Calculation fields depending on plug-in info or script triggers | Use scripts |
| Script trigger activation | Not supported (scripts run server-side, triggers do not fire) |

Scripts run by OData API calls are **server-side scripts** — they behave the same as those run by the Perform Script on Server script step, running in separate processes from standard OData API calls.

## Data format support

| Format | Request | Response | Notes |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- | ----- |
| JSON | `application/json` | `application/json` (default) | Default format |
| Atom/XML | `application/atom+xml` or `application/xml` | `application/atom+xml` or `application/xml` | For XML-structured data |
| HTML | — | `text/html` | Response only |
| Multipart | `multipart/mixed` | `multipart/mixed` | For `$batch` operations |
| Binary | (container-specific Content-Type) | (container-specific) | For container field binary updates |

## HTTP method support

| Method | Used for |
| ------ | ------- |
| `GET` | Metadata, query, request data |
| `POST` | Create record, create table, create field index, run script, update record references, create webhook |
| `PATCH` | Update record, update record references, update container (binary), add fields to table |
| `PUT` | Create record (alternative), update record, update record references, update container, add fields to table |
| `DELETE` | Delete record, delete table, delete field, delete index, update record references (detach) |
