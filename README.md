# fms-odata-spec

A canonical base reference for the **Claris FileMaker Server OData API**, intended as the single source of truth that downstream libraries (MCP servers, JavaScript wrappers, and any future wrappers) conform to and evolve against.

## Purpose

This project provides a **unified source of conventions and a version-aware capability list** for the Claris FileMaker Server OData API. It serves as a common platform to unify FileMaker OData implementations across different languages, runtimes, and tool ecosystems.

The Claris OData API has evolved across server versions (2023, 2024, 2025, 2026) with subtle behavioral differences, undocumented quirks, and version-gated features. Without a shared reference, each wrapper library independently discovers and works around the same issues, leading to divergent implementations and duplicated effort.

This repository solves that by providing:

1. **A single, documented contract** for what the FileMaker OData API does and does not support — so every wrapper implements the same behavior instead of guessing.
2. **A version-aware capability matrix** that maps FileMaker Server versions to supported features, query options, and endpoint availability — so wrappers can detect the server version and gate functionality accordingly.
3. **A propagation point for API changes** — when Claris releases a new FileMaker Server version, the update happens here first, then flows to every derived library.
4. **Three explicit categories of coverage**:
   - **Standard OData features** that FileMaker covers.
   - **Standard OData features** that FileMaker explicitly does *not* cover (so wrappers don't try to implement them).
   - **Non-OData additions** specific to FileMaker (containers, scripts, webhooks, custom `Prefer` headers, metadata annotations, system tables, etc.).

### Companion type packages

The spec ships three independent, language-specific type packages that mirror the
same API surface. They share no runtime dependency on each other and are
versioned/published independently using their respective package managers.

| Package | Language | Registry | Install |
| ------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| `@fms-odata/spec-ts` | TypeScript | npm | `npm install @fms-odata/spec-ts` |
| `fms-odata-spec` | Python | PyPI | `pip install fms-odata-spec` |
| `fsans/fms-odata-spec-php` | PHP | Packagist (unpublished) | `composer require fsans/fms-odata-spec-php` |

**TypeScript package** (`packages/fms-odata-spec-ts/`):

```bash
cd packages/fms-odata-spec-ts
npm install
npm run build        # tsc -> dist/
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit
```

**Python package** (`packages/fms-odata-spec-py/`):

```bash
cd packages/fms-odata-spec-py
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest                           # run the test suite
python -m build                  # build sdist + wheel into dist/
```

**PHP package** (`packages/fms-odata-spec-php/`):

```bash
cd packages/fms-odata-spec-php
composer install
composer test        # PHPUnit
composer analyse     # PHPStan level max
composer check       # tests + static analysis
```

The Python and PHP folders are intentionally **not** part of any npm workspace
glob; the three package managers are kept fully decoupled. Each package has its
own CI workflow scoped to its own path filter (`.github/workflows/py-ci.yml`
for Python, `.github/workflows/php-ci.yml` for PHP).

## Version targeting

The spec covers these FileMaker Server versions, with deltas documented in [docs/12-version-deltas.md](docs/12-version-deltas.md):

| Version | Codename | Status |
| --------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Claris FileMaker 2023 | v20.x | Supported |
| Claris FileMaker 2024 | v21.x | Supported |
| Claris FileMaker 2025 | v22.x | Supported |
| Claris FileMaker 2026 | v26.x | Current (primary reference) |
| Future / next | — | Reserved section for announced changes |

## Source of truth

The spec is built from:

1. **Official Claris OData API documentation** (<https://help.claris.com/en/odata-guide/>) — primary source.
2. **Observed behavior** from the two existing wrapper repositories (`fms-odata-mcp` and `fms-odata-js`) — real-world quirks, workarounds, and undocumented behaviors.

Where official docs and observed behavior diverge, both are documented and the discrepancy is noted.

## How downstream libraries use this

- **Read the docs** to understand what the API supports and what it doesn't.
- **Import the TypeScript types** from `packages/fms-odata-spec-ts` (`@fms-odata/spec-ts` on npm) for shared type definitions in JS/TS projects.
- **Import the Python types** from `packages/fms-odata-spec-py` (`fms-odata-spec` on PyPI) for shared type definitions in Python projects.
- **Import the PHP types** from `packages/fms-odata-spec-php` (`fsans/fms-odata-spec-php` on Packagist) for shared type definitions in PHP projects.
- **Consume the JSON manifest** (`schema/fms-odata-capabilities.json`) to programmatically check feature availability per FileMaker Server version.
- **Follow the reconciliation matrix** (docs/14-reconciliation.md) when aligning divergent implementations.

## OData protocol version

FileMaker Server 2023 (v20.x) implements **OData 4.0**. FileMaker Server 2024 (v21.x) and later implement **partial OData 4.01** at intermediate conformance level, with some exceptions. The URL version segment remains `v4` for all versions. See [docs/01-conformance.md](docs/01-conformance.md) for the full conformance level and feature support matrix.

## Branching model

This repository uses a Git Flow-style workflow:

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable releases only. Every commit on `main` is a merge from `develop` and is tagged with a version tag (`v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.). |
| `develop` | Active development. All work lands here first via direct commits or feature branches merged back. |

**Workflow:**

1. Work on `develop` (or a feature branch off `develop`).
2. When a set of changes is ready for release, merge `develop` into `main`.
3. Tag the merge commit on `main` with an annotated version tag (`vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`).
4. Push both branches and the tag to `origin`.

**Tagging convention:**

- Tags follow semantic versioning: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the spec/TS package, `py-vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` for the Python package, and `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (bare, no prefix) for the PHP package.
- Tags are annotated (`git tag -a`) with a summary of what changed.
- Spec/TS and Python tags are created on `main`. PHP tags are created on the `php-package` branch (a subtree split of `packages/fms-odata-spec-php/` to the repo root, required because Packagist only reads `composer.json` from the repository root).
- If the `@fms-odata/spec-ts` npm package version changes, the tag version should match the package version.

**PHP package publishing (Packagist):**

The PHP package lives in `packages/fms-odata-spec-php/` in this monorepo, but Packagist only reads `composer.json` from the repository root. To publish:

1. Ensure the work is merged to `main` and `develop`.
2. Create the subtree split branch: `git subtree split --prefix=packages/fms-odata-spec-php -b php-package`
3. Tag the split branch: `git tag -a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH -m "PHP package MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH — ..."`
4. Push: `git push origin php-package --tags`
5. On Packagist, submit the repo URL `https://github.com/fsans/fms-odata-spec`. Packagist will find `composer.json` on the `php-package` branch and resolve versions from bare `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tags.

**Current tags:**

| Tag | Commit | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `v1.0.0` | `a8c7d9a` | Initial spec: 15 docs, JSON manifest, spec-ts types package |
| `v1.1.0` | `307389f` | Multi-strategy version detection aligned with fms-odata-mcp |
| `v1.1.1` | `b3b23ba` | Script result envelope fix + FMS v26 quirks |
| `v1.2.0` | `b72ab04` | Complete fm-odata -> fms-odata rename (package, directory, schema, all references) |
